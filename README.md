# Sorting_and_Searching
Implementation of simple sorting and searching algorithms using C++.
The algortihms used on the programs are Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Linear search, Binary search and Linked List for sorting and searching purposes.

#Sorting and searching of Student information.
Sorting and searching of Student information using simple sorting and searching algorithms. The program contains an implementation of simple sorting and searching algorithms, concepts in data structure and algorithm (DSA). For sorting Bubble sort, Insertion sort and Selection sort were implmented and for searching Linear and Binary search were used. Here is the general overview of the program:- When user presses "1", the program asks to enter student information after asking the amount of data recieved. Which is inserting Student Id, Student Name and Age. The program accepts only a number as Student Id. After the user inserts Student information. They can perform the following information:- -> View the data inserted by pressing "2", -> Perform:- sort by Student Id by pressing "3" (using bubble sort), sort by Student Name by pressing "4" (using selection sort), sort by Age by pressing "5" (using insertion sort), search by Age by pressing "6" (linear searching) and search by Student name (using binary searching). -> User can also delete the data of Student after inserting Student Id by pressing "8"  -> Users can also press "9" to know team members of the project and "0" to exit the program.
-> The main purpose of using these searching algorithms is to have organized data input and that of searching is accessing data in need without having to go through the entire data. -> The time it takes to sort a given amount of data varies from one sorting algorithm to another. Also the time it takes to access a data by searching varies from one searching algorithm to another. The time it take to sort or search data is called Time Complexity. All the concepts on this program are well taught on the course Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA).
N.B: This project elaborates on the use of Simple sorting and searching algorithms after sorting and searching of book information program.

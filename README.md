# Sorting and searching of book information.
Program: Sorting and searching of book information using simple sorting and searching algorithms. 
The program contains an implementation of simple sorting and searching algorithms, concepts in data structure and algorithm (DSA). For sorting purposes the program used bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort and for searching linear and binary search were used. Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until no swaps are needed, indicating that the list is sorted. Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that divides the input list into two parts: a sorted part at the beginning and an unsorted part at the end. Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to how you might sort a hand of playing cards. It builds a sorted array one item at a time. Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a straightforward searching algorithm that examines each element in a list or array sequentially to find a target element. Binary search is a highly efficient searching algorithm that leverages the fact that the input list or array must be sorted. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
Here is the general overview of the program:- When user presses "1", the program asks to set book information. Which is inserting Author name, Book title and Book Id. The program accepts only a number as Book ISBN. After the user inserts book information. The can perform the following operations:-  -> View the book information inserted by pressing "2", -> Perform:- sort by Book Id by pressing "3" (using bubble sort), sort by Book title by pressing "4" (using selection sort), sort by Author name by pressing "5" (using insertion sort), search by book Id by pressing "6" (linear searching) and search by author name (using binary searching). -> The main purpose of using these searching algorithms is to have organized data input and that of searching is accessing data in need without having to go through the entire data. Users can also press "8" know the team of the project and "0" to exit the program.
-> The time it takes to sort a given amount of data varies from one sorting algorithm to another. Also the time it takes to access a data by searching varies from one searching algorithm to another. The time it take to sort or search data is called Time Complexity. All the concepts on this program are well taught on the course Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA).

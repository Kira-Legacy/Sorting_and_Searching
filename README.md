# Sorting_and_Searching
Implementation of simple sorting and searching algorithms using C++.
The algortihms used on the programs are Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Selection sort, Linear search, Binary search and Linked List for sorting and searching purposes.

# Sorting of Movie information using Linked List Algorithm. 
The program contains an implementation of linked list, a concept in data structure and algorithm (DSA). A linked list is a linear data structure that consists of a sequence of nodes, each containing two fields:   
Data: The actual data stored in the node. Next: A pointer (link) to the next node in the sequence.   
This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements at any position in the list, but accessing a specific element requires traversing the list from the beginning. 
In the program, a user inputs information about movies and can use linked list to sort the information inserted. Here is the general overview of the program:- by pressing "1", "2" and "3", user can add movie information at the start, at the end or at a specific place respectively. User also can delete movie information from the start, from the end or at a specific position by pressing "4", "5" and "6" respectively.  Users can also press "7" to know team members of the project and "0" to exit the program.
Linked list is also a fundamental concept in the course Data Structre and Algorithms (DSA).

# Sorting and searching of book information.
Sorting and searching of book information using simple sorting and searching algorithms. 
The program contains an implementation of simple sorting and searching algorithms, concepts in data structure and algorithm (DSA). For sorting bubble sort, selection sort and insertion sort were implmented and for searching linear and binary search were used. Here is the general overview of the program:- When user presses "1", the program asks to set book information. Which is inserting Author name, Book title and Book Id. The program accepts only a number as Book ISBN. After the user inserts book information. The can perform the following operations:-  -> View the book information inserted by pressing "2", -> Perform:- sort by Book Id by pressing "3" (using bubble sort), sort by Book title by pressing "4" (using selection sort), sort by Author name by pressing "5" (using insertion sort), search by book Id by pressing "6" (linear searching) and search by author name (using binary searching). -> The main purpose of using these searching algorithms is to have organized data input and that of searching is accessing data in need without having to go through the entire data. Users can also press "8" know the team of the project and "0" to exit the program.
-> The time it takes to sort a given amount of data varies from one sorting algorithm to another. Also the time it takes to access a data by searching varies from one searching algorithm to another. The time it take to sort or search data is called Time Complexity. All the concepts on this program are well taught on the course Data Structure and Algorithms (DSA).
